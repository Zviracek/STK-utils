This foler contains scripts and other files required for my workflow around Judo Shiai.

Currently, it contains following tools:
- Scripts
    - importer.py - creates csv for import into Shiai from registered competitors
    - aditional.py - creates csv for import into Shiai for manualy sellected IDs
    - analyzer.py - takes JSON from Shiai and calculates usefull statistics

*All the files for scripts are hardcoded, and require manual changes. In the future, I would like to rewrite them to use command line arguments.*
