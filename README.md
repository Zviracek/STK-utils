# STK-utils

This repository contains bunch of utility scripts, that I use to automate most of tasks regarding planning and management of judo competitions. 

Those are:
- Calendar generation
- shai_utils - Judo shiai importing and creating statistics
- Generation of ranking list
- Shiai supporting files
  - Base Shiai template
  - Custom quad pool system
- kata_draw - Program for generating distributions for kata competitions
- los_v2 - drawing for regular competitions - semi unmaintained

With some more to come.

All those scripts are suited for czech language and are usualy modified on the go. I do not provide any waranty that they will work without the supporting knowladge that I posses. However, my goal is to make them easily modifiable and user friendly, so anyone can benefit from those automations.
