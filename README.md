# STK-utils

This repository contains bunch of utility scripts, that I use to automate most of tasks regarding planning and management of judo competitions. 

Those are:
- Calendar generation
- Judo shiai importing and creating statistics
- Generation of ranking list

With some more to come.

Ale those scripts are suited for czech language and are usualy modified on the go. I do not provide any waranty that they will work without the supporting knowladge that I posses. However, my goal is to make them easily modifiable and user friendly, so anyone can benefit from those automations.
