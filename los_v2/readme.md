Script setup for drawing competitions
Currently only maintained for drawing U10 without fixed weights by groups of 3 or 4.
Input files are specificaly structured excel files inputed from Kluby folder.

I am not the original author of the template excel files. Those were part of a manual system which I was allowed to use and redistribute however I want to build an automation over them.
